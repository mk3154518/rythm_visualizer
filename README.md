# <h1>ðŸŽµ Rhythm Visualizer</h1>
<p>Rhythm Visualizer is a fun and interactive web app that visualizes rhythmic motion using moving balls on curved tracks, while playing corresponding tones in sync. Each ball follows its own track, with sound and color that match its rhythm.</p>

<h2>ðŸŒŸ Features</h2>
<ul><li>Animated balls orbiting along tracks in rhythmic motion
</li>
<li>Each ball plays a tone when completing a cycle (like a music beat)</li>

<li>Beautiful neon-inspired design using CSS and hsl() color scheme</li>

<li>Responsive to user interaction with a Start Music button</li>

<li>Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€“ no external frameworks needed</li>
</ul>
<h2>ðŸŽ¶ How It Works</h2>
<ul><li>When you press Start Music, the audio context is activated (due to browser restrictions on auto-play).</li>

<li>Multiple tracks are drawn as curves, and each track gets a ball that moves in a rhythmic pattern.</li>

<li>Each ball triggers a different musical note (frequency) when completing one round.</li>

<li>The animation loops continuously using requestAnimationFrame.</li></ul>
<h2>ðŸ”§ Tech Stack</h2>
<li>HTML5 Canvas</li>

<li>CSS3 (custom fonts and neon glow effects)</li>

<li>JavaScript (Object-Oriented, Web Audio API)</li></ul>
